# Spam Email Classification using LSTM 📧🤖

## Overview 📝

This project explores building a classification model to differentiate between **Spam** and **Legitimate (Ham)** emails using **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)** networks. The notebook details the end-to-end process of preparing the data, training the model, and evaluating its performance.

The focus is on using **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques for text preprocessing and **Deep Learning** to classify emails based on their content. By the end of the project, we aim to have a trained model that can effectively predict whether an email is spam or legitimate.

## Key Steps in the Process 🛠️

### 1. **Data Collection & Preprocessing 📊**
- **Loading the Data**: The dataset consists of emails labeled as **Spam (1)** or **Legitimate (0)**.
- **Text Normalization**: We start by converting text to lowercase and removing unnecessary characters, such as numbers, punctuation, and special symbols.
- **Stopword Removal**: Common words that do not contribute to meaningful classification (like "the", "and", etc.) are removed.
- **Hyperlink Removal**: URLs and hyperlinks in the text are deleted as they do not provide useful information for classification.
- **Tokenization**: We split the email text into individual words (tokens) for easier processing.

### 2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) 🔍**
- **Visualizing the Data**: The notebook includes visualizations such as word clouds and n-gram analysis, which help in understanding the most common terms used in spam and legitimate emails.
- **Class Distribution**: The dataset is explored to understand the distribution of spam vs. legitimate emails, which helps in deciding model evaluation strategies.

### 3. **Feature Engineering ⚙️**
- **Text Tokenization**: The email text is tokenized into sequences, and the vocabulary is built.
- **Padding**: As the text data varies in length, padding is applied to ensure that all input sequences have the same size, making them suitable for model input.
- **Label Encoding**: The target labels (spam or legitimate) are encoded into numeric values (0 or 1) using LabelEncoder.

### 4. **Model Construction 🏗️**
- **Bi-directional LSTM**: We use a **Bi-directional LSTM** model to process the sequence of words in both forward and backward directions. This helps capture contextual information from both past and future words.
- **Dense Layer**: A fully connected layer with **ReLU** activation is added to capture non-linear relationships between features.
- **Dropout**: A dropout layer is included to prevent overfitting and help the model generalize better.

### 5. **Model Training 🚀**
- The model is trained on the preprocessed training data using **binary cross-entropy loss** and the **Adam optimizer**.
- **Early Stopping** is implemented to monitor the validation loss and stop training once the model starts overfitting.
- **Evaluation**: The model is evaluated on a separate test set to determine its accuracy and ability to generalize to unseen data.

### 6. **Model Evaluation and Results 📊**
- **Training Metrics**: The model's performance during training is tracked by monitoring the loss and accuracy.
- **Validation Metrics**: The validation loss and accuracy provide insight into how well the model generalizes.
- **Overfitting**: If the validation accuracy starts to drop while training accuracy continues to rise, it indicates overfitting. This is addressed by using techniques like **early stopping**.

## Goals of the Project 🎯
- To classify emails as **Spam** or **Legitimate** using deep learning.
- To explore NLP techniques for text preprocessing and sequence classification.
- To evaluate the model's performance on both training and validation sets, and improve it through strategies like **early stopping** and **dropout**.

## Results 📈
- The model’s performance on the training data is typically high, with **99%** accuracy.
- On the validation data, accuracy usually reaches around **97%**, though slight fluctuations are observed due to overfitting.

## Conclusion 🎓
By the end of this project, you will have a functional **Bi-LSTM model** for spam email classification that can be further fine-tuned, deployed, or integrated into a larger system for filtering unwanted emails. Techniques like **early stopping** are crucial to prevent overfitting and ensure the model’s generalizability.
